# Phoenixcra
This project was created to demonstrate the create-react-app and elixir phoenix 1.4 stack. This is also in reference to my medium post [Create React App and Elixir Phoenix 1.4](https://medium.com/@ken11zer01/create-react-app-and-elixir-phoenix-227678660257)

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) from your browser and be served by the create-react-app server.
